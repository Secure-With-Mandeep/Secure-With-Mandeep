I am A CyberSecurity professional with a profound interest in Offensive Security. A Certified Ethical Hacker and about to attempt OSCP (fingers crossed)

## Objective
Brother-Watch is my project where you'll find tools for Recon, Scanning, Brute Forcing, Gaining Access, Privledge Escalation and Phishing etc etc (popular tools and my own). Eventually, i will combine all the tools above into one tool called Brother-Watch. 
The idea behind Brother-Watch is  to pick a ctf or target and do the majority of what you need to do in one terminal-tab itself. That way you can have multiple targets or ctfs among multiple tabs. you can use this if you get bored of a ctf/target and still want to maintain consistency and productivity, you can have multiple open at the same time. (ethically ofcourse)

 
**DISCLAIMER**
This tool is only meant for Educational and Ethical purposes. Never use it on Systems you dont have permission for and always use ctfs for learning purposes.
