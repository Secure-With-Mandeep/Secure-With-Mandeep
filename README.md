I am a CyberSecurity professional with a profound interest in Offensive Security. OSCP and CEH certified who is slowing delving into the world of Ai as well. 

## Objective                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                    
Brother-Watch is my work in progress project where you'll find tools for Recon, Scanning, Brute Forcing, Gaining Access, Privledge Escalation and Phishing etc etc (popular tools and my own). Eventually, i will combine all the tools above into one tool called Brother-Watch. It will be UI friendly with Interactive Shell asking you want do you wanna do next? and then list options of tools to perform it. further once you choose a tool, it will ask what options you wanna set for tool to perform. 
The idea behind Brother-Watch is to pick a ctf or target ethically and do the majority of what you need to do in one terminal-tab itself. That way you can have multiple targets or ctfs open among multiple tabs and still feel organised. You can use this if you get bored of a ctf/target and still want to maintain consistency and productivity, you can have multiple open at the same time. (ethically ofcourse)

 
**DISCLAIMER**
- This tool is only meant for Educational and Ethical purposes. Never use it on Systems you don't have permission for and always use ctfs for learning purposes.
